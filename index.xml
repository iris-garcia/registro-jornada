      <description>Description Travis is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.
It provides a free plan for open source projects which is very convinient for our use case.
The whole configuration is set up in a single file .travis.yml which must be placed in the root directory of the project.
Configuration To avoid replicating exactly the same workflows in GitHub Actions and Travis, there are some little changes like testing two different Go versions: v1.</description>

      <description>Go The open source programming language Go will be used to develop the whole project, mainly because I want to try a new language and this one is becoming quite popular nowadays.
Gin Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API with much better performance &amp;ndash; up to 40 times faster.
It is very well documented and provides many handy features like authentication, data validation and a configurable logger out of the box.</description>

      <description>Workday is a RESTful API project that allows the management of workers&amp;rsquo; day registration, for this purpose it makes use of a relational database where such data persists.
It allows the creation of different types of users (roles), initially there are two main roles:
 employee: The employee has permissions to:  Register checks in and checks out. Update their own password. Update their own schedule.  HR: The Human Resources role is the one with almost full control, it has the permissions of a regular employee plus:  Retrieve every employee&amp;rsquo;s schedule.</description>

      <description>Since last May 12, 2019 every Spanish company is required to provide their employees a process to record their working hours.
This process can be as simple as signing in a paper the checks in and checks out for every single workday; but any other process can be used and this is the reason for which I decided to develop this project.</description>

      <description>Description GitHub Actions is the new continuous integration and deployment system built and maintained by the community.
Configuration Currently there are two workflows configured:
Test with verbosity enabled To make it a bit different that the pipeline configured in Travis CI, this one will run the tests with verbosity enabled, this way it outputs every spec and API call done for each test case.
An example of one run can be seen here.</description>

      <description>Description Currently the API allows the following actions:
   Method Endpoint     GET /status   GET /employees   POST /employees   GET /employees/{id}   DELETE /employees/{id}   PUT /employees/{id}    BDD has been used to test every possible use case to reach a 100% code coverage it is worth to mention that the database has been mocked so the current tests are Unit tests, leaving the Integration tests for a later iteration.</description>
