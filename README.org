* Workday
** What's the idea?
Since last May 12, 2019 every Spanish company is required to provide
their employees a process to record their working hours.

This process can be as simple as signing in a paper the checks in and
checks out for every single workday; but any other process can be used
and this is the reason for which I decided to develop this project.

Initially the idea is to provide a RESTful API which could be used in
any company to register those checks in and checks out, and allow the
"administrators" to retrieve the data at any time they are requested
to.

** How is it going to be developed?
- RESTful API design.
- Test-driven development and Behavior-driven development.
- Isolated development environment (probably using Docker containers).
- Continuous Integration.
- Gitflow workflow.
- Storing persistent data in a relational database.
- Logging services.
- Authentication
