      <description>Workday is a RESTful API project that allows the management of workers&amp;rsquo; day registration, for this purpose it makes use of a relational database where such data persists.
It allows the creation of different types of users (roles), initially there are two main roles:
 employee: The employee has permissions to:  Register checks in and checks out. Update their own password. Update their own schedule.  HR: The Human Resources role is the one with almost full control, it has the permissions of a regular employee plus:  Retrieve every employee&amp;rsquo;s schedule.</description>

      <description>Since last May 12, 2019 every Spanish company is required to provide their employees a process to record their working hours.
This process can be as simple as signing in a paper the checks in and checks out for every single workday; but any other process can be used and this is the reason for which I decided to develop this project.</description>
